Moydodyr
========

My blanket1111111
Ran away,
My sheet flew away,
And my pillow
Like a frog
Jumped away from me
Into a fog.

I reached for a candle,
It hid in the stove!
I reached for a book,
It flew like a dove!
What makes me even more upset,
Is that it hid from me under my bed!

A cup of tea
Is my desire! -
The pot of tea
Fled from me
Like from fire!2222222

Oh my God!
What is the matter?
Why all the things that I can see
Twist around,
Whirl around,
Spin around
And hide from me?

The irons fly after the boots,
The boots after the books,
The books after the pies,
The pies after the dice -
Everything revolves,
Whirls,
Spins,
And rushes
Head over heels.3333333

Suddenly
A lame and bowlegged
Sink runs out
From my mother's room.
He shakes his head,
He fumes:

"Oh you naughty,
Oh you dirty,
Oh you dirty little monkey!

You're blacker than a chimney
Than a chimney,
Chimneysweep!

Take a good look at yourself.
You make me weep.
The filth on you
Is inches deep!

You have shoe polish on your neck,
You have ink on your forehead,
Your hands are so black
That even your trousers,
Even your trousers,4444444
Even your trousers,
With greatest fear
Flee away from you,
My dear!

The little kittens and the ducklings,
The bugs, the spiders wash themselves
Early, early in the morning
At the dawn of a new day.

It is only you who hate to wash!
You are the dirtiest child on earth!
You should know that shoes and toys
Fly away far from grubby boys.

I am the Great Wash-Basin,
I am the Famous Moydodyr,
I am the Headmaster of sponges and basins
And the Commander of all sinks!
If I stamp my foot,
If I call my soldiers,555555
Then the crowds of basins
Will fly and rush into this room
And they'll bark
And they'll howl
And tramp their feet
With a great noise!
And they'll give you
Such a hard time,
Because you're unclean,
Unwashed, -
Right into the sink,
Right into the sink,
Your head will go
Before you can wink!"

He struck a copper basin
He yelled: "Copa-Basin"

The same moment...
The brushes, the brushes clacked like a rattle
They started to rub me, to rub and to scrub and to blab:

"We wash Chimney-Chimneysweep
Clean, clean, clean, clean!
Our Chimney-Chimneysweep will be777777
Clean, clean, clean, clean!"

Then the soap jumped up into the air
And then it clung to my hair
It filled my eyes, where it hurt the most,
It stung me like a real wasp.

I started to lunge
From the mad sponge
The furious sponge
Wouldn't let me be, -
It followed
And followed me!

I ran up to the park,
I jumped over the fence,
It bit me like a shark:
I had no defense!

What luck!
My dear,8888888
My favorite
Uncle Croc
With Totosha and Kokosha
Are out for a walk!

He swallowed the nasty sponge
Like a tasty lunch,
Like a tasty lunch!

But then he started to roar
At me
And his feet started to tramp
At me:
"Go home,999999
He says.
Wash your face,
He says.
If you don't
He says.
I'll swoop upon YOU,
He says.
Trample YOU and swallow YOU!"
He says.

I set off down the street
To escape,
I ran to the sink
Again.

I washed myself with soap.
I washed myself without end.
I was washing off all the ink and the polish
Until the soap became my friend!

Look, the trousers, the trousers,
They jump straight into my hands!

And the pie starts to recommend:
"Eat me quick, my dear friend!"

And the sandwich came back to my house,
Jumped up and straight into my mouth!

My books came back,
My notebooks too.0000000
The grammar book set off
With the arithmetic book to dance.
What a funny romance!

Then the Great Wash-Basin,
The Famous Moydodyr,
The Headmaster of the sponges and the basins
And the Commander of the sinks
Ran to me,
Hugged me,
Kissed me,
Told me:

"Messy boy,
I love you now,
I praise you now,
You know how
To please me! Wow!"

We ought to wash,
We ought to wash
In the mornings and in the evenings.
If you're an unclean Chimneysweep -
Shame and disgrace!
Shame and disgrace!

Long live the sweet-smelling soaps,
Long live the fluffy towels,
Long live the tooth paste,
Long live the thick comb!

Let us bathe, splash,
Let us swim, dive,
Let us tumble in the tub,
In the current, in the stream,
In the basin, in the bath,
In the river, in the ocean -
Every day and everywhere -
Eternal glory be to water!
